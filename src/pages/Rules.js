      <ol>
        <li>Full workout should consist of 3 to 5 rounds.</li>
        <li>Each set should be 40 to 60 seconds long.</li>
        <li>Rest should be 20 to 30 seconds long.</li>
        <li>On round 5 you should feel intensive burn in target muscles. Keep that burn for 10-15 seconds. If you don't feel the burn then increase set duration or intensity.</li>
        <li>Want to train same muscle more? Rest minimum 10 minutes before repeating workout. 5 workouts a day should be enough even for an olympic athlete. 1-2 workout is enought for rest of us.</li>
